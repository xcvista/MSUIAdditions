# MSUIAdditions
> Classes that should be in UIKit but never reached

## Introduction
This library includes several classes that Apple should include in UIKit - very
basic, common UI elements.

## Use
You can simple place this project as a subproject in your project and link your
application against it. You may want to check out `iOS universal framework` if
you see bullseyes in Xcode. (They should be yellow toolboxes)
